# The Shire
### Group Members:
Jenna Schulman, Andrew Sayadi, Camille Hensley, and Cameron Anderson

## How to Run
1) First, you have to download php, you can find out how to do that here. 
https://www.php.net/manual/en/install.windows.tools.php

2) Afterwards, you'll need to download a mysql server. There are many ways to do that, but I do it through the official mysql workbench app. You can download that here.
https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/

3) You'll need to import the sce.sql file into a project schema.

4) Put the repository in your htdocs folder(If serving from XAMPP)

5) Finally, you'll need to change the database.php file to contain your credentials for connecting to the database
