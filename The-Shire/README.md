2) Afterwards, you'll need to download a mysql server. There are many ways to do that, but I do it through the official mysql workbench app. You can download that here.

3) You'll need to import the sce.sql file into a project schema.

4) Put the repository in your htdocs folder(If serving from XAMPP)

5) Finally, you'll need to change the database.php file to contain your credentials for connecting to the database
